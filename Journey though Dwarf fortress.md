4:00 PM:  I completely don't understand how this game works.
The whole point of the game is to commands the dwarfs and make them works, which strenghen the tribe I'm leading.  But I think the dwarfs doesn't like an 12 year old in command, because they never do what I order them. All the commands in the manual that involve jobs, somehow never work for me. What's more annoying is that the only dwarf that works in the game is the dwarf that I never give any command to.

7:00 PM: the game is not so confusing after all.
Most labors require an designation, which settles the area the dwarfs are going to do their jobs on and the jobs the dwarfs are going to do in that area. But I didn't set a designation, that's why the dwarfs didn't do their work.
Note: Even though I figured out how most of the laboring works, I still don't understand how mining works.

I spent one and a half hours studying how to make the dwarfs build and collect things; the results are very surprising. Making the dwarfs collecting is very easy, all you need to do is type p when you are at the main manual, which stands for stockpile. Then, choose the type of objects you wants to collect. All your dwarfs are suppose to be collecting after that.

Making the dwarfs builds is very complex process compare to collecting. First you need to build(b is the command) workshops for the dwarfs to crafts more advance things. Than, you need to have the metarials for the dwarts to craft. Ativate the workshop are also a pain in the neck, you need a manager and setting a task on the workshop. Last but definely not least, make sure your worker can crafts by checking the laboring manual.

It's been a wonderful day for our city of Orukman. We are very lucky to have Orkumann as the ruler. The palace he construct for us is amazing; he is the servent of the people. Spending all the material and manpower on the best interest of the people. The city he design for us will make New York looks like an crumble old villege. He have all the wisdom, kindness, and every other good words I can say about him in his heart.

Truth: Orkumann don't even know his left hand from his right. The building he constucted; that's suppose to be our palace is as lame as hell. There is 19 of us and he only make 3 beds, what's even more annoying is that there's only one room. The city is also poorly design with everyone's workshop skatter everywhere. There are no extra building apart from the workshops and the "palace" and he didn't even notice when his citizens are dying of thirst.

I learn something very important today, **it's possible to lose in dwarf fortress**. Unfortunally I have to learn it the hard way. My tribe had run out of water supply and there are no rivers near by, I should I have construcked a well. But I'm busy with the things that don't have much importance. 

Althought it's possible the lose in dwarf fortress, it's not easy. A player can only lose when all of his citizens are gone.

The wood era is over! The stone era have begun! I finally understood how does mining works. The areas that are green and surround be the yellow walls can't be mined. But I thought that's the only area exists, because outside the walls there are only total blackness. And the result is "Hidden" when I look at it. 

It took me 4 days to figure that out. When I finally did, it's by accident. I wented to dwarffortesswiki for the mining guild. I already read the actical many times, but I'm still hoping I will find something that I missed earlier. I didn't; I scroll to the top and started reading it over again. Something caught my eye at the top, it's a GIF showing how to designates a mining area that I didn't paid any attention to earily. The GIF is showing a the yellow designated area against the black background. I put things togather after that, my dwarfs are suppose to mine on the "Hidden" not the green fields.

It's the last day of April, apperently it's also the last day of my second dwarf fortress game. I lost the second game in the same way I did in the first one; dehydration. The game actually started pretty well, I get the hang of mining. Build a lot of workshops and other useful construcktion from stones and woods. I even manage to lend my hands on gems.


My dwarfs started getting thirsty about 3 hours into the game. But I haven't notice it until they start working very slowly, which means that they will die of dehydration soon. The problem with dwarf fortress is that there are so much information the player don't even know which to focus on. 

I did build a well for them; but I guess wells dry up very quickly in dwarf fortress, because my dwarfs never manage get a drop of water out of it. I try to build another well, but my workers gets couldn't concentrate on their jobs because of a Kea(that's a kind of parrot). I couldn't understand why would this happen, from the desciption in dwarffortresswiki it's just an harmless bird and my workers didn't leave their jobs to catch to the bird neither.

I spend 1 hour studying traps. In Dwarf fotress there are two kinds of traps, animals traps and military traps. 

Animal traps is kind of like fishing(real life fishing). You put a bait in the trap and wait for the victim. There are 3 kinds of bait, meat, fish, and large gem. I have no idea which creature will fall for the large gem, but meat and fish are use for catching small animals that you can't find in your animal list. The good thing about animal traps is that it usually caught it's victim very quickly, animals will fall for the trap about 1-2 minutes after the trap have been set up. Animal traps and only be use once, the dwarfs will automaticlly destroy them after the trap caught it's victim.

There are 5 kind of military traps. Every trap except cage trap kills or hurts it's victim. I don't know much about the other traps. Cage trap is basicly the opposite of animal trap, it can be use multiple times and it took it's time catching large, high value animals.
