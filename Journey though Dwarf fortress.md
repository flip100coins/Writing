First thought on the game:  I completely don't understand how this game works.
The whole point of the game is to commands the dwarfs and make them works, which strenghen the tribe I'm leading.  But I think the dwarfs doesn't like an 12 year old in command, because they never do what I order them. All the commands in the manual that involve jobs, somehow never work for me. What's more annoying is that the only dwarf that works in the game is the dwarf that I never give any command to.

Second thought: the game is not so confusing after all.
I finally understand why the dwarfs won't listen to me. When I sent them to mined the first time, the mining area I picked are full of grass and so the dwarfs refuse the mined.
