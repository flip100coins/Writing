4:00 PM:  I completely don't understand how this game works.
The whole point of the game is to commands the dwarfs and make them works, which strenghen the tribe I'm leading.  But I think the dwarfs doesn't like an 12 year old in command, because they never do what I order them. All the commands in the manual that involve jobs, somehow never work for me. What's more annoying is that the only dwarf that works in the game is the dwarf that I never give any command to.

7:00 PM: the game is not so confusing after all.
Most laboring need to set a designation, which settles the area the dwarfs to going to do their jobs on and the jobs the dwarfs are going to do.

I spent one and a half hours studying how to make the dwarfs build and collect things; the results are very surprising. Making the dwarfs collecting is very easy, all you need to do is type p when you are at the main manual, which stands for stockpile. Then, choose the type of objects you wants to collect. All your dwarfs are suppose to be collecting after that.

Making the dwarfs builds is very complex process compare to collecting. First you need to build(b is the command) workshops for the dwarfs crafting more advance artifacts. Than, you need to have the metarials for the dwarts to build. Ativate the workshop are also a pain in the neck, you need a manager and setting a task on the workshop. Last but definely not least, make sure your worker have the crafting option on in the labor manual.
