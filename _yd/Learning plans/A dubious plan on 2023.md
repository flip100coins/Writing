Things that may need help and companionship from other people: physics, SICP, Math(?), drawing(?).

Things that I can do on my own and consume little time from other people: Magic the gathering, chess(?), English writing, Chinese writing(?).

Note: the subjects with a "?" may needs further planning and confirmation.
