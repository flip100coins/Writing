## Ashley
In gone with the wind, Ashley play in a leading role He is a well educated person and value his honor, southern honor; beyond anything. In other words, he is a southern gentleman. He is a rich aristocrat from the South. Because of that, he doesn't need to struggle for his position in the society and can afford to be a loyal-to-South gentleman.

When the civil war begun, he joined the Southern army and fought for the South. Even though he personally thinks the war is pointless for the South. Because the South is fighting for it's own culture, and if it wins the war, then the South will be able to command the prices of the cotton and people will be thinking of making money like the North instead of returning to the care free life of the days before the war. And if the South loses the war, which it did, the southerners will never be able to return to the life of the old days neither.

After the civil war ended, Ashley lost everything he once owned, his plantation was burned to the ground by union soldiers, his slaves was freed, and his money in became worthless because of the war. That meant Ashley, like many other southerners, will have to work, in order to live. This is hard, because most of southern aristocrat, don't know any money making skills, but people can always learn and change, change from the old days. The interesting thing is, Ashley know that he won't be likely to make any success in the new society if he doesn't changes. And even with this knowledge, he refused to changes.
