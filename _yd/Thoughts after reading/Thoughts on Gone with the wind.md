Reading a book is like throwing a dice, the result of your action depends upon yourself, the object, and a bit of luck.

In gone with the wind, Ashley is the most notable character my opinion. He is a educated person and have a strong sense of conscience. But, the important thing is, he can afford to listen to his conscience, because he was born in a rich family from the South and doesn't need to struggle for his position in the society. 

When the civil war begun, he joins and fights for the Southern army, even though he thinks war is pointless for the South. Because the South is fighting for it's own culture, and if it wins the war, then the South will be able to command the prices of the cotton and people will be thinking of making money like the North instead of returning to the care free life of the days before the war. And if the South loses the war, which it did, the southerners will never be able to return to the life of the old days neither.

After the civil war ended, Ashley lost everything he once owns, his plantation was burned to the ground by union soldiers, his slaves was freed, and his money in became worthless because of .
