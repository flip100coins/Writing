Reading a book is like throwing a dice, the result of your action depends upon yourself, the object, and a bit of luck.

## Ashley
In gone with the wind, Ashley is the one of the most common character, and the most notable in my opinion. He is a well educated person and value his honor, southern honor; beyond anything. In other words, he is a southern gentleman. Because he was born in a rich family from the South and doesn't need to struggle for his position in the society.

When the civil war begun, he joined the Southern army and fought for the South. Even though he personally thinks the war is pointless for the South. Because the South is fighting for it's own culture, and if it wins the war, then the South will be able to command the prices of the cotton and people will be thinking of making money like the North instead of returning to the care free life of the days before the war. And if the South loses the war, which it did, the southerners will never be able to return to the life of the old days neither.

After the civil war ended, Ashley lost everything he once owned, his plantation was burned to the ground by union soldiers, his slaves was freed, and his money in became worthless because of the war. That meant Ashley, like many other southerners that don't know any specify skills, will have to work, in order to live. This is hard, but manageable. But Ashley is not just any southerners, he is a honorable southerner.
