There's 20 first moves in Atomic. But only 5 moves is winning for white, 1 move is drawing, and the rest of them is losing.
The 5 winning moves are e4, e3, d4, Nh3, and Nf3. And the drawing move is Nc3. Among all those moves, Nf3 is the strongest move, god of all gods. The famous openings in Atomic, 2N and Spam (they are famous and hated becuase their adventage for white) starts with Nf3. With the best-played Nf3, white could defeat black in 40 moves, and there are no counter-play with Spam.
The rest of the moves, however, is love for their not so big adventage, e4, e3, d4, and Nh3 probably ends in 80 moves, any human can make remarkble mistakes in 80 moves.
