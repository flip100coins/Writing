Project goal: finding out how jobs influence contribute with dwarf fortress mode.

Project plan: body contributes(body contributes are contributes involve with body) influence how fast dwarf learns in military training. The plan is to train all my workers, and see which work influence body contribute the most by the result of how fast they learn.

Project advantage: dwarfs like learning new things, so the project isn't going to influence by the dwarfs emotion.

Project disadvantage: the project can only find out how jobs influence body contributes.

Project details: creating a squad for every kind of workers and a separate training room for each squad.

Project update: nothing yet, I have been training wood workers, stone workers, and miners, but they seems to learn at the same speed. Maybe I'm wrong about jobs influence contributes. 

Project update: all  my squads seems to learn fighting at about the same speed. The only pattern I could find is that dwarfs with high learning skills learn things faster than those without.
