Adventure mode is kind of like fortress mode's sister. Everything on the screen in adventure mode is exactly the same with fortress mode, the plants, the animals, the people, and the created goods. Adventure mode and fortress mode's likeness doesn't stops at the screen, if you play both modes on the same map, the civilizations, sites, historical figures, artifacts, and building will also be the same.

Like sisters in real life, adventure mode looks like fortress mode but are not exactly the same as fortress mode. The biggest difference is that in fortress mode, you control dozens, even hundreds of dwarfs; but in adventure mode you only got to control one dwarf. Since you are controlling a dwarf, you are seeing the world in a dwarf's angle and view.

## Time

In fortress mode, time passes in a constant speed. A day in fortress mode is equal to 40 seconds in real life, unless, your computer is lagging. But in adventure mode, the real time-game time equation depends on what you are doing. If you are doing nothing at all, time stops in adventure mode. 

## Sites

Sites is a complex element in adventure mode. There's useful products in almost every sites, like well-craft weapons and armors; it's also a place full of intelligent creatures; some sites are also targets for elimination; and they are only way to visit the caverns.
There are many kind of sites, but all of them can be split into two groups, sites of the main civilizations which is dwarf, goblin, elves, human and kobold sites and the other sites.

There are two kind of dwarf sites, fortresses and hillocks. Fortresses are one complex, gigantic hole dug deep underground; while hillocks are more like real life village with small, above and underground buildings. The goblins site are almost the same as dwarf sites, goblins has their own fortress that are call dark fortress and also has their own hillock with the name dark pit. Elves only live on tree houses, which gives them a natural adventure when it comes to defending sites(shooting arrows down the trees is always easier than shooting the other way around). The humans in dwarf fortress, like the humans in real life, live in above-ground buildings. Kobolds doesn't build sites in their name; instead, they build bandit sites. 

Usually, the bandits and undead sites won't have as much citizens as the sites of the main civilizations. But they attack every visitor and kill them. They are also very good at it too, almost 90% of the citizens in the bandits site are fighters and the undeads also have an advantage in fighting because they can't feel pain.

Most beasts have their own site. Although they won't build much in it, they will attack anyone who have entered their territory.

## Races

In adventure mode, you don't need to be a dwarf. In fact, you don't even need to be in the main races at all. You can be anything at all intelligent, tiger man, lion man, and even bat man. I'm really amaze that, there's so many other intelligent creatures and none of then ever become historical figures. Maybe because they life in the wild and never bother to creates civilizations. 

## Caverns 

Caverns are connective layers that connect fortresses together, there's even little fortresses that can only be visited from the caverns. 

## Attribute

Since you are only controlling one creature, attributes in adventure mode is a lot more important than in fortress mode. They affects your character's body and are directly involve with how it's mind works. 

## Skills

In fortress mode, it's very easy to improve labor skills for dwarfs. To improve labor skills, one can just assign a dwarf a certain labor and it will improve the skills involve with that labor when it does the job. The dwarfs can do a specify labor as many times as you can assign them before their deaths; but they can only improve a skill to a certain level.

This is how the circle for laboring in fortress mode looks like: laboring --> improves skills that are involve with that labor --> the dwarf does that labor better --> laboring. 

Improving combats skills require a longer time, with the military training. But it's also fairly easy.

Here's the circle of improving combat skills: military training --> improves all the skill that are needed to win a fight --> military training. 

***

In adventure mode, improving labor skills is almost impossible. Because you can't do any jobs that can improve the skill until you learn the skill. The labor circle for fortress mode is broken in adventure mode at the beginning. But it's still possible to learn a labor skill in adventure mode, players can visit guildhalls, which is a place for teaching and learning certain labor skills. But guildhalls is one of the very rarest building and getting permission to visit one is also a tough job.

Circle of improving labor skills in adventure mode: learning a skill in a guildhall --> doing the labor involving the skill --> improving the skill --> doing the labor involving the skill.

Improving combat skills in adventure mode are both easier and more dangerous. There's no military training in adventure mode; so the only way to improve combat skills is real fighting. Real fight is nothing like military training, a player improves their combat skills, or they die trying. But the good news is, finding a training target is way more easier than finding a guildhall, there's plenty of creatures that are weaker than you.

Circle of improving combats skills in adventure mode: real battle --> improving combat skills --> real battle.

And the version of circle breaking: real battle --> death.

## Combats

Combats are the soul of adventure mode. There are times when I'm playing fortress mode; and wishing I could switch to adventure mode with one of the fighters as my character when a war occurred. 

There's only 4 things that matter in a fight, combat skills, weapons, armors , and body 
attributes.

### Combat skills

There are a few skills that affect how you do in a fight, generally; no matter which weapon you are holding, I call them general combat skills. Specify skills is the skills the only help you when you are holding a specify kind of weapon.

There's only two kind of general combat skill, fighter skill and archer skill. Fighter skill affect how you do in any close range combat and can also be practice and improve at, in close range combat. The funny thing about fighter skill is that, you don't need to hold a weapon to practice and improve it, kicking, biting, striking, and wrestling can also improve fighting.  Archer skill also have the same affect on long range combat. Do it sounds like cheating that you can improve archer skill by using a long range weapon on nothing? I can actually improve my character's archer skill by shooting a tree.

There are about 30 kind of specify combat skills, nearly half of them are weapon skills. But dwarfs don't know 50% of the weapons skills, because they don't know how to craft them. Lucky that you are playing adventure mode, you can just visit goblin/human sites and grab the weapons that dwarfs can't craft. 

Every good fighter is a good dodger. Without it, you are only a target waiting to be hit. Being a good dodger meant you can win a fight with multiple opponent. Good dodgers will nearly never be hit; and if it's opponent is worst at dodging, it can just take them down one by one. And if you are bad at dodging, you opponent will surely hit you wounded you, which will affect your fighting greatly. Dodging is also you friend when you are trying to escape. Just running away and in a close combat results showing weaknesses, your opponent will have the chance to mortally wounded you before you can escape. But if you dodge away first, your opponent won't have the chance, and than you can run for you life.

Armor skills and armor is the last defense against harm, armor skills controls how well you uses the armor. A good armor user can wear the heaviest armor and not fell a thing, while non-armor user is going to have trouble walking. I think armor skill also effect how well the armor protects you in combats, but I don't know for sure.

I like to see shield skill as a defensive weapon skill, it's really effective in defending. But that's all, a shield have nearly no other uses about from that. And what make a shield sound even more useless? A weapon can also be use in defending, and if you are good enough at it, it might work as well as a shield.

Thrower and misc. object user skill is also worth mentioning, since they can be practice with non-weapon objects and affect how a creature use them in combats. A legendary thrower and misc. object user might even win a fight with sticks and rocks against mega-beasts.
