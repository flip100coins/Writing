**Atomic theory and computer analyzing**

Atomic theory can be very confusing and chaotic, different level humans and engines's strategy can be totally different. 

As a chess variant, the adventages in Atomic is the same with chess. Positional adventage and material adventage. The positional adventage in Atomic is very hard to master for human, especially in the opening. Humans can only calculate a few moves and can't posibly еvаluаtе chaotic Atomic openings

Unlike chess, however, white have positional adventage in Atomic, even in the first move. But it can be easily mess up by humans. Humans can only calculate a few moves; that is way not enough for this chaotic game. The evalution can be unclear, because short of calculation. However,  there are Atomic masters that can evaluate positions almost as clear as the engine. 

The human strategy in Atomic for white is to convert the easily mess up positional adventage into more easily handle meterial adventage. As white tries to convert the adventages; black's counter-play is going to be avoiding the lose of meterial, of course. But it isn't as easy as it sounds; there isn't many moves for black that avoid losing material and doesn't leads to a position that is totally unplayable for black.

The engine, as you may have already known uses a complete different strategy. It does clossal calculations and find the best moves for either side.
