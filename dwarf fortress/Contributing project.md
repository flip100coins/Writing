Project goal: finding out how jobs influnce contribute with dwarf fortress mode.
Project plan: body contributes(body contributes are contributes involve with body) influnce how fast dwarf learns in military training. The plan is to train all my workers, and see which work influnce body contribute the most by the result of how fast they learn.
Project advantage: dwarfs like learning new things, so the project isn't going to influnce by the dwarfs emotion.
Project disadvantage: the project can only find out how jobs influnce body contributes.

Project update: nothing yet, I have been training wood workers, stone workers, and miners, but they seems to learn at the same speed. Maybe I'm wrong about jobs influnce contributes.
