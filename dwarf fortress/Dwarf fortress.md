Describing Dwarf fortress is very easy. In fact, I can do it in one word. The word is "confusing". If you want me to describe it more clearly, it's 90% confusing 10% magnificent.

There are so much information about the game, that your brain will have trouble taking it all in. In most video games, the commands are simple, directing your mouse or fingers at a location will control them and usually you would have no trouble of understanding what's going go from the screen. While in Dwarf fortress there are at least 40 commands and all of them involve the keyboard. What's going on in the screen is even more confusing, it is made up with little simbols which you never seen before and will have a hard time understanding what it stands for.  

The modes of the game also does a great job of confusing the brain with it's totally different struture. But the 10% magnificent are also in the modes. How can I put it? The modes of Dwarf fortress are like sun and moon. Each with it's own beaulty, while being totally different.
