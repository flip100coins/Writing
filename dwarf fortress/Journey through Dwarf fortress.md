4:00 PM:  I completely don't understand how this game works.
The whole point of the game is to commands the dwarfs and make them works, which strenghen the tribe I'm leading.  But I think the dwarfs doesn't like an 12 year old in command, because they never do what I order them. All the commands in the manual that involve jobs, somehow never work for me. What's more annoying is that the only dwarf that works in the game is the dwarf that I never give any command to.

7:00 PM: the game is not so confusing after all.
Most labors require an designation, which settles the area the dwarfs are going to do their jobs on and the jobs the dwarfs are going to do in that area. But I didn't set a designation, that's why the dwarfs didn't do their work.
Note: Even though I figured out how most of the laboring works, I still don't understand how mining works.

I spent one and a half hours studying how to make the dwarfs build and collect things; the results are very surprising. Making the dwarfs collecting is very easy, all you need to do is type p when you are at the main manual, which stands for stockpile. Then, choose the type of objects you wants to collect. All your dwarfs are suppose to be collecting after that.

Making the dwarfs builds is very complex process compare to collecting. First you need to build(b is the command) workshops for the dwarfs to crafts more advance things. Than, you need to have the metarials for the dwarts to craft. Ativate the workshop are also a pain in the neck, you need a manager and setting a task on the workshop. Last but definely not least, make sure your worker can crafts by checking the laboring manual.

It's been a wonderful day for our city of Orukman. We are very lucky to have Orkumann as the ruler. The palace he construct for us is amazing; he is the servent of the people. Spending all the material and manpower on the best interest of the people. The city he design for us will make New York looks like an crumble old villege. He have all the wisdom, kindness, and every other good words I can say about him in his heart.

Truth: Orkumann don't even know his left hand from his right. The building he constucted; that's suppose to be our palace is as lame as hell. There is 19 of us and he only make 3 beds, what's even more annoying is that there's only one room. The city is also poorly design with everyone's workshop skatter everywhere. There are no extra building apart from the workshops and the "palace" and he didn't even notice when his citizens are dying of thirst.

I learn something very important today, **it's possible to lose in dwarf fortress**. Unfortunally I have to learn it the hard way. My tribe had run out of water supply and there are no rivers near by, I should I have construcked a well. But I'm busy with the things that don't have much importance. 

Althought it's possible the lose in dwarf fortress, it's not easy. A player can only lose when all of his citizens are gone.

The wood era is over! The stone era have begun! I finally understood how does mining works. The areas that are green and surround be the yellow walls can't be mined. But I thought that's the only area exists, because outside the walls there are only total blackness. And the result is "Hidden" when I look at it. 

It took me 4 days to figure that out. When I finally did, it's by accident. I wented to dwarffortesswiki for the mining guild. I already read the actical many times, but I'm still hoping I will find something that I missed earlier. I didn't; I scroll to the top and started reading it over again. Something caught my eye at the top, it's a GIF showing how to designates a mining area that I didn't paid any attention to earily. The GIF is showing a the yellow designated area against the black background. I put things togather after that, my dwarfs are suppose to mine on the "Hidden" not the green fields.

It's the last day of April, apperently it's also the last day of my second dwarf fortress game. I lost the second game in the same way I did in the first one; dehydration. The game actually started pretty well, I get the hang of mining. Build a lot of workshops and other useful construcktion from stones and woods. I even manage to lend my hands on gems.


My dwarfs started getting thirsty about 3 hours into the game. But I haven't notice it until they start working very slowly, which means that they will die of dehydration soon. The problem with dwarf fortress is that there are so much information the player don't even know which to focus on. 

I did build a well for them; but I guess wells dry up very quickly in dwarf fortress, because my dwarfs never manage get a drop of water out of it. I try to build another well, but my workers gets couldn't concentrate on their jobs because of a Kea(that's a kind of parrot). I couldn't understand why would this happen, from the desciption in dwarffortresswiki it's just an harmless bird and my workers didn't leave their jobs to catch to the bird neither.

I spend 1 hour studying traps. In Dwarf fotress there are two kinds of traps, animals traps and military traps. 

Animal traps is kind of like fishing(real life fishing). You put a bait in the trap and wait for the victim. There are 3 kinds of bait, meat, fish, and large gem. I have no idea which creature will fall for the large gem, but meat and fish are use for catching small animals that you can't find in your animal list. The good thing about animal traps is that it usually caught it's victim very quickly, animals will fall for the trap about 1-2 minutes after the trap have been set up. Animal traps and only be use once, the dwarfs will automaticlly destroy them after the trap caught it's victim.

There are 5 kind of military traps. Every trap except cage trap kills or hurts it's victim. I don't know much about the other traps. Cage trap is basicly the opposite of animal trap, it can be use multiple times and it took it's time catching large, high value animals.

In dwarf fortress, the most important factor is drinks. Without drinks, your dwarfs will die as quickly as the fastest car on earth. The good thing about drinks is that, it's very easy to make from plants. If you got a stable supply of drinks, there's a fairly low chance that your fortress will be defeated.

Another important factor is food, it's also very easy to optain from plants.

Most material and products in dwarf fortress are easy to optain and make, only metal and metal product are exceptions. But metal is very hard to mine.

Subject:
Military is the only factor that determind win and lose on high level dwarf fortress. The military unit is measure in squad which have 10 dwarfs and is lead by an militia commander. They are responsible for raiding, attacking other site, defending the fortress and rescueing the people that have been capture.  

Raiding a site is like gambling, don't not raid a site until you are 90% sure that you will seceed. I sent a spuad to raid a site 3 times today(just to see how it works), I didn't gain anything from the first raid. But my troop manage to raid 5 animals and a bunch of weapons on the second. I was naive and thought I could devepe my fortress by raiding and nothing else. I learn a lesson soon, on the third time I sent my troop only 4 dwarfs came back. The rest of them is neither imprison nor killed.

Subject: Fortress growing
There are nothing in the world that is like watching your own fortress growing. However, "growing" can have a very vague meaning in dwarf fortress, it can mean the number of people increasing in your site, the increase of wealth in your fortress, the increase of military strength, and a lot more. 

Growing can be very hard sometime, with underground beasts, goblin raiders, and other troubles. But that's why dwarf fortress are attractive, the feeling of accomplishment as your fortress grow through troubles that killed your last fortress.

Today, I have learnt and experience many things in dwarf fortress. The design of civilization are amazing and the way dwarf populations works are also worth marveling.

In the game, you start with 7 dwarfs and a single world. Your civilization can't even count as tiny compare to the 200 people and muti-world civilizations. However, a well design fortress grow very quickly, in 3-4 dwarf fortress years, it's population should have reach 100(by attracting migrants). But other civilizations won't wait for you to catch up, they will also grow and expend even farther.

Suppose you have two worlds, then you will attract twice as much migrants each year. But you can't just go to a place that's not occupy and built another fortress, you have to attack a civilization and seize it's world. It's not hard to seize a small civilization and to make things better, there are a number of them. 

But you have no way of knowing if it's a sheep in a pack of wolf or just a sub-world of a giant empire. Even if it's just a sheep and you manage to catch it, it also meant catching the attention of the giant-empires. Which will attack you if they decided it's worth the trouble(I don't know how they decides that, but I guess it mostly base on wealth). 
Edit: there's actually an way for knowing if it's a sub-world of an giant empire.

This is the ideal fortress in my opinion; when it's small, its dwarf have to do many kind of jobs. But a fortress will grow and when its population reach 20; only a few dwarfs needed to do multiple jobs. And when it's population reach 50 there's no need for multiple jobs anymore.
Edit: dwarfs are require to do multiple jobs they will went mad if they can't.

Ores have a way of hiding their identity in dwarf fortress. Take iron ore for an example, it's actually one of the most common ore; but you will never find a natural metarial with "iron" in dwarf fortress. Instead, there's a bunch of stone that's suppose to be iron ore with strange names like "lignate". Other ores are a little better, there's gold nugget for an example. But most of the gold resource came also came from stones with odd names.

18.5.23

If dwarf fortress is a sword, only the design of civilizations can be its blade and only races can manage to be on the tip. The most common creatures in dwarf fortress are, dwarf, goblin, elves, human, and kobold. Each with different belief and action. 

Goblins are aggressive monsters; they will attack every site and destroy it if they succeed. The only reason goblins haven't been wipe out for making so many enemy is because only they know techniques like training trolls.

Humans are smarter, they send agents to other sites that pretented to be visitors; while their real goal is find out the site's secret and reports to their gorverment. Their goverment desided if the site is worth attacking after that, but sometimes agents will desided to steal valuable items on their own.

Elves are nature lovers, and are willing to starts wars over a pile of woods, but they are peaceful creatures apart from that. Like goblins, they also have their special techniques, but it isn't as strong and useful as the goblin's.

Kobolds are thiefs that doesn't build any sites, they will sneak into your sites and steal the childrens and vaulable objects.

Dwarfs are... Well they are dwarfs. I never seen dwarfs in an objective angle, but I think they are a combination of goblins and humans; with goblin's aggressive attacks and human's agent strategy.

So this is the civilizitions of dwarf fortress with goblins, dwarfs, humans, and elves continuously attacking each other creating an endless war, while kobold crept into their site and steal their children and actifacts.

Dwarf fortress is an interesting game, every single part of it is easy; but putting them together and your head is going to explode. Making an indivual happy and growing the fortress is an very good example. 

The whole point of dwarf fortress is growing the fortress; so you might think making an indivual happy is not that important, wrong! Emotion is the only thing that matter to a dwarf's focus. Poor focus can make an dwarf half the strength it actually is, and sharp focusing can make an dwarf 50 percent better. 

Keeping a indiviture happy in dwarf fortress is actually a lot harder than growing the fortress. Making a dwarf happy require having the chance to do a job with brain work, fighting, and socialize. Doing jobs, fighting and socialize aren't easy but isn't hard neither; all you need to do is to give the ideal ament of training time and work time. But there are only limiting jobs imvolve with brain working, you can't make all your dwarfs actist, can you?



20.5.23

Only three things are needed to build an strong military in dwarf fortress and only they can build it, weapon, armor, and fighting skills. In other jobs, better equipment and higher skills only speeds the progress and produce better products. But in military, it means dominating the region or getting crush to ruin.




22.5.23

After wasting 4 hours trying to make all my dwafs 100% happy, I finally realize it's impossible. The reason is simple; in dwarf fortress, different dwarfs enjoy different things and sometimes the things they enjoy are exactly opposite. There's actually an explanation why; different dwarfs have different contributes(strength, agile, willpower, etc) and that influnce the things they enjoy. But contributes can be change through jobs(I found this out at advanture mode). This leads to a question, what kind of jobs influnce what kind of contribute? Naturally, I could play advanture mode and find out; but it's hard finding a job there and it might take a long time to try all the jobs. For solving this problem, I created contributing project.


23.5.23

How does people descibe the way Germans fought in world war 1 and 2? They won the battles but lose the war. That's exactly what had happened to my soldiers. I send my best and secend best squad(1 squad have 10 fighters) to openly attacked an goblin site that have 20 cidizens. They done their job pretty well at first, my commander out match the defending commander, my dwarfs killing 3 goblins without even getting injuried. But that's before the goblins got help from 125 war dogs and trolls. Even after the goblins got help, my dwarfs keep on winning battles, killing way more enemy than they get killed. But they lose the war all the same, they are badly outnumber and the goblins have a nice possitional advantage because the battles are taking place at their site.

Contributing project update.
