4:00 PM:  I completely don't understand how this game works.
The whole point of the game is to commands the dwarfs and make them works, which strenghen the tribe I'm leading.  But I think the dwarfs doesn't like an 12 year old in command, because they never do what I order them. All the commands in the manual that involve jobs, somehow never work for me. What's more annoying is that the only dwarf that works in the game is the dwarf that I never give any command to.

7:00 PM: the game is not so confusing after all.
Most labors require an designation, which settles the area the dwarfs are going to do their jobs on and the jobs the dwarfs are going to do in that area. But I didn't set a designation, that's why the dwarfs didn't do their work.
Note: Even though I figured out how most of the laboring works, I still don't understand how mining works.

26.4.23

I spent one and a half hours studying how to make the dwarfs build and collect things; the results are very surprising. Making the dwarfs collecting is very easy, all you need to do is type p when you are at the main manual, which stands for stockpile. Then, choose the type of objects you wants to collect. All your dwarfs are suppose to be collecting after that.

Making the dwarfs builds is very complex process compare to collecting. First you need to build(b is the command) workshops for the dwarfs to crafts more advance things. Than, you need to have the materials for the dwarfs to craft. Ativate the workshop are also a pain in the neck, you need a manager and setting a task on the workshop. Last but definely not least, make sure your worker can crafts by checking the laboring manual.

It's been a wonderful day for our city of Orukman. We are very lucky to have Orkumann as the ruler. The palace he construct for us is amazing; he is the servent of the people. Spending all the material and manpower on the best interest of the people. The city he design for us will make New York looks like an crumble old villege. He have all the wisdom, kindness, and every other good words I can say about him in his heart.

Truth: Orkumann don't even know his left hand from his right. The building he constucted; that's suppose to be our palace is as lame as hell. There is 19 of us and he only make 3 beds, what's even more annoying is that there's only one room. The city is also poorly design with everyone's workshop skatter everywhere. There are no extra building apart from the workshops and the "palace" and he didn't even notice when his citizens are dying of thirst.

28.4.23

I learn something very important today, **it's possible to lose in dwarf fortress**. Unfortunally I have to learn it the hard way. My tribe had run out of water supply and there are no rivers near by, I should I have construcked a well. But I'm busy with the things that don't have much importance. 

Althought it's possible the lose in dwarf fortress, it's not easy. A player can only lose when all of his citizens are gone.

29.4.23

The wood era is over! The stone era have begun! I finally understood how does mining works. The areas that are green and surround be the yellow walls can't be mined. But I thought that's the only area exists, because outside the walls there are only total blackness. And the result is "Hidden" when I look at it. 

It took me 4 days to figure that out. When I finally did, it's by accident. I wented to dwarffortesswiki for the mining guild. I already read the actical many times, but I'm still hoping I will find something that I missed earlier. I didn't; I scroll to the top and started reading it over again. Something caught my eye at the top, it's a GIF showing how to designates a mining area that I didn't paid any attention to earily. The GIF is showing a the yellow designated area against the black background. I put things togather after that, my dwarfs are suppose to mine on the "Hidden" not the green fields.

30.4.23

It's the last day of April, apperenlly it's also the last day of my second dwarf fortress game. I lost the second game in the same way I did in the first one; dehydration. The game actually started pretty well, I get the hang of mining. Build a lot of workshops and other useful construcktion from stones and woods. I even manage to lend my hands on gems.


My dwarfs started getting thirsty about 3 hours into the game. But I haven't notice it until they start working very slowly, which means that they will die of dehydration soon. The problem with dwarf fortress is that there are so much information the player don't even know which to focus on. 

I did build a well for them; but I guess wells dry up very quickly in dwarf fortress, because my dwarfs never manage get a drop of water out of it. I try to build another well, but my workers gets couldn't concentrate on their jobs because of a Kea(that's a kind of parrot). I couldn't understand why would this happen, from the desciption in dwarffortresswiki it's just an harmless bird and my workers didn't leave their jobs to catch to the bird neither.

I spend 1 hour studying traps. In Dwarf fortress there are two kinds of traps, animals traps and military traps. 

Animal traps is kind of like fishing(real life fishing). You put a bait in the trap and wait for the victim. There are 3 kinds of bait, meat, fish, and large gem. I have no idea which creature will fall for the large gem, but meat and fish are use for catching small animals that you can't find in your animal list. The good thing about animal traps is that it usually caught it's victim very quickly, animals will fall for the trap about 1-2 minutes after the trap have been set up. Animal traps and only be use once, the dwarfs will automatically destroy them after the trap caught it's victim.

There are 5 kind of military traps. Every trap except cage trap kills or hurts it's victim. I don't know much about the other traps. Cage trap is basically the opposite of animal trap, it can be use multiple times and it took it's time catching large, high value animals.

6.5.23

In dwarf fortress, the most important factor is drinks. Without drinks, your dwarfs will die as quickly as the fastest car on earth. The good thing about drinks is that, it's very easy to make from plants. If you got a stable supply of drinks, there's a fairly low chance that your fortress will be defeated.

Another important factor is food, it's also very easy to optain from plants.

Most material and products in dwarf fortress are easy to optain and make, only metal and metal product are exceptions. But metal is very hard to mine.

8.5.23 

Subject:
Military is the only factor that determine win and lose on high level dwarf fortress. The military unit is measure in squad which have 10 dwarfs and is lead by an militia commander. They are responsible for raiding, attacking other site, defending the fortress and rescueing the people that have been capture.  

Raiding a site is like gambling, don't not raid a site until you are 90% sure that you will succeed. I sent a squad to raid a site 3 times today(just to see how it works), I didn't gain anything from the first raid. But my troop manage to raid 5 animals and a bunch of weapons on the second. I was naive and thought I could devepe my fortress by raiding and nothing else. I learn a lesson soon, on the third time I sent my troop only 4 dwarfs came back. The rest of them is neither imprison nor killed.

15.5.23

Subject: Fortress growing
There are nothing in the world that is like watching your own fortress growing. However, "growing" can have a very vague meaning in dwarf fortress, it can mean the number of people increasing in your site, the increase of wealth in your fortress, the increase of military strength, and a lot more. 

Growing can be very hard sometime, with underground beasts, goblin raiders, and other troubles. But that's why dwarf fortress are attractive, the feeling of accomplishment as your fortress grow through troubles that killed your last fortress.

16.5.23

Today, I have learnt and experience many things in dwarf fortress. The design of civilization are amazing and the way dwarf populations works are also worth marveling.

In the game, you start with 7 dwarfs and a single world. Your civilization can't even count as tiny compare to the 200 people and muti-world civilizations. However, a well design fortress grow very quickly, in 3-4 dwarf fortress years, it's population should have reach 100(by attracting migrants). But other civilizations won't wait for you to catch up, they will also grow and expend even farther.

Suppose you have two worlds, then you will attract twice as much migrants each year. But you can't just go to a place that's not occupy and built another fortress, you have to attack a civilization and seize it's world. It's not hard to seize a small civilization and to make things better, there are a number of them. 

But you have no way of knowing if it's a sheep in a pack of wolf or just a sub-world of a giant empire. Even if it's just a sheep and you manage to catch it, it also meant catching the attention of the giant-empires. Which will attack you if they decided it's worth the trouble(I don't know how they decides that, but I guess it mostly base on wealth). 
Edit: there's actually an way for knowing if it's a sub-world of an giant empire.

This is the ideal fortress in my opinion; when it's small, its dwarf have to do many kind of jobs. But a fortress will grow and when its population reach 20; only a few dwarfs needed to do multiple jobs. And when it's population reach 50 there's no need for multiple jobs anymore.
Edit: dwarfs are require to do multiple jobs they will went mad if they can't.

17.5.23

Ores have a way of hiding their identity in dwarf fortress. Take iron ore for an example, it's actually one of the most common ore; but you will never find a natural material with "iron" in dwarf fortress. Instead, there's a bunch of stone that's suppose to be iron ore with strange names like "lignate". Other ores are a little better, there's gold nugget for an example. But most of the gold resource came also came from stones with odd names.

18.5.23

If dwarf fortress is a sword, only the design of civilizations can be its blade and only races can manage to be on the tip. The most common creatures in dwarf fortress are, dwarf, goblin, elves, human, and kobold. Each with different belief and action. 

Goblins are aggressive monsters; they will attack every site and destroy it if they succeed. The only reason goblins haven't been wipe out for making so many enemy is because only they know techniques like training trolls.

Humans are smarter, they send agents to other sites that pretented to be visitors; while their real goal is find out the site's secret and reports to their government. Their government decides if the site is worth attacking after that, but sometimes agents will decided to steal valuable items on their own.

Elves are nature lovers, and are willing to starts wars over a pile of woods, but they are peaceful creatures apart from that. Like goblins, they also have their special techniques, but it isn't as strong and useful as the goblin's.

Kobolds are thieves that doesn't build any sites, they will sneak into your sites and steal the children and valuable objects.

Dwarfs are... Well they are dwarfs. I never seen dwarfs in an objective angle, but I think they are a combination of goblins and humans; with goblin's aggressive attacks and human's agent strategy.

So this is the civilizations of dwarf fortress with goblins, dwarfs, humans, and elves continuously attacking each other creating an endless war, while kobold crept into their site and steal their children and actifacts.

19.5.23

Dwarf fortress is an interesting game, every single part of it is easy; but putting them together and your head is going to explode. Making an individual happy and growing the fortress is an very good example. 

The whole point of dwarf fortress is growing the fortress; so you might think making an individual happy is not that important, wrong! Emotion is the only thing that matter to a dwarf's focus. Poor focus can make an dwarf half the strength it actually is, and sharp focusing can make an dwarf 50 percent better. 

Keeping a individual happy in dwarf fortress is actually a lot harder than growing the fortress. Making a dwarf happy require having the chance to do a job with brain work, fighting, and socialize. Doing jobs, fighting and socialize aren't easy but isn't hard neither; all you need to do is to give the ideal admont of training time and work time. But there are only limiting jobs involve with brain working, you can't make all your dwarfs actist, can you?



20.5.23

Only three things are needed to build an strong military in dwarf fortress and only they can build it, weapon, armor, and fighting skills. In other jobs, better equipment and higher skills only speeds the progress and produce better products. But in military, it means dominating the region or getting crush to ruin.




22.5.23

After wasting 4 hours trying to make all my dwarfs 100% happy, I finally realize it's impossible. The reason is simple; in dwarf fortress, different dwarfs enjoy different things and sometimes the things they enjoy are exactly opposite. There's actually an explanation why; different dwarfs have different contributes(strength, agile, willpower, etc) and that influence the things they enjoy. But contributes can be change through jobs(I found this out at adventure mode). This leads to a question, what kind of jobs influence what kind of contribute? Naturally, I could play adventure mode and find out; but it's hard finding a job there and it might take a long time to try all the jobs. For solving this problem, I created contributing project.


23.5.23

How does people describe the way Germans fought in world war 1 and 2? They won the battles but lose the war. That's exactly what had happened to my squads. I send my best and second best squad(1 squad have 10 fighters) to openly attacked an goblin site that have 20 citizens. They done their job pretty well at first, my commander out match the defending commander at planing, and my dwarfs killing 3 goblins without even getting a scratch. But that's before the goblins got help from 125 war dogs and trolls. Even after the goblins got help, my dwarfs keep on winning battles, killing way more enemy than they get killed. But they lose the war all the same, they are badly outnumber and the goblins have a nice positional advantage because the battles are taking place at their site.

Contributing project update.

24.5.23

An bloody war had just taken place on my site. A goblin army with 40 solders attacked my fortress; and I sent my best squad to meet them. The war ended quickly, with victory in my hand. My squad killed all the attackers, but 3 of my best solders also die, including my military commander. 

To be honest, 3 solders aren't much to pay for fending off an attack; but a skill commander? That's more than enough. When squads attack a site, half of the success depends on the military commander. The hard thing about getting a good commander is that nothing other than a real battle can improve it's skill. So, to have an good military commander it need to attack a site and survive back to improve.

***

I have done it! I have reach the caverns! Caverns are huge underground tunnels that only appear in 40- levels or below. Inside it there's eatable plants, beasts, fishes, webs, and other interesting things that I haven't stumble on yet.


Contributing project update

25.5.23

Is defensive battle a kind of default military training, or I haven't seen any real war? My fortress faced two attacks today, my squads manage to kill at least 90% of my attackers without losing a single dwarf. 

The first attack is form by mostly goblins, but there's also humans and elves. At the first attack, there are about 10 grizely bears and elves that ambush the defenders. But they are no match for my dwarfs, they slaughter them like pigs. The rest of the invaders wasn't any luckier either; they put up a fight, but most of them got killed by my dwarfs all the same.

The second attack is form by purely goblins, there's 40 of them. The second attack is just like the first, my dwarfs winning and killing most of the invaders without getting killed.

---

So, I have been thinking. If my dwarfs are so strong, fending off 2 attacks without even losing a single dwarf; why couldn't they win any battle when they are the attackers?


26.5.23

I had dug through 100th levels and no magma. It's actually very annoying, because magma is one of the most interesting substance. Magma can be use to power up magma smelters and forges which could replace coal burning smelters and forges. That would stops the manpower wasted on coal once and for all. But the usefulness of magma doesn't stops on melting metals, it can be use to design traps and other stuff. What's fun about magma is that it will never cools down.



27.5.23

The dwarf fortress mode and adventure mode in dwarf fortress is, in a degree, the opposite of each other. The player know everything in fortress mode, from the big changes of civilization to tiniest details of mussel shell. And from the information, the player tries to make the fortress as strong as possible. But it's the exact opposite in adventure mode, the player don't have any information on the world. But they don't have to worry about growing the fortress or staying alive. 

28.5.23

The real danger in dwarf fortress isn't from the outside threat of civilizations, but from the inside danger of caverns. The threat of civilizations only come in military forces from outside of the fortress which makes it really hard to hurts the citizens inside the fortress. But the beasts from the caverns is even more unpredictable than the threat in outside and it can do to way more damage since it's already in your fortress. To make matters worst, caverns are full of valuable material, that doesn't appear elsewhere. And if there are workers in the place of the generated beast, they will be kill faster before than my solders 
could grab their weapon, let alone save them.

***

It's **industrial revolution**! I have discovered magma sea, adamantine, and diamond. It meant my fortress will be able to produce better products with greater speed. For example, making clothing from thread is a complicated process, dwarfs are needed at collecting webs and then weave them into clothes; but with adamantine my fortress will be able to produce more useful adamentine clothing with fewer processes. 

Discovering magma are also an breakthrough. Like I said before; with magma, I could replace coal burning smelters and forges with magma forges and smelters. It meant I could stop wasting *dwarf-power* producing coals.

I'm not sure diamond will be as useful as magma and adamantine. But it could be decorate with finished goods like any other gems which would increase my wealth a lot.

29.5.23

I have two meetings with beasts in dwarf fortress so far, they are very strong, more powerful than my best solder; but not indestructible. I bet they can take down any other creatures I had seen so far at a 1 to 1 battle. Although they are powerful, being seriously outnumbered 1 to 10 by my solders is the main reason they got killed without managing to take down anyone with them.

***

Prepare foods will actually rots in dwarf fortress even if they are store in barrels. Which makes sense, after all, barrels aren't refrigerators. Although there isn't any refrigerators in dwarf fortress, foods won't rot if they are store in wagons or stockpiles. 

I didn't know that, and haven't designated enough area for food storing, so my dwarfs leaves them in the kitchens. I paid the price for it, about 95% of my foods rotted and what's left of will be eaten in a week. So I need all of my dwarfs to starts producing foods which won't strengthen my fortress very much, they are gathering plants, hunting and fishing. That's not all, rotten foods produce miasma which is what dwarfs hates and I have to wait for them to throw away all of the rotten food before they can starts producing foods. 


31.5.23

I had conquered a site! My worst active squad was sent to conquered an elf site with less than 10 people. If the squad(s) successfully conquer a site; the dwarfs won't come back, so sending my best squads doesn't seems like a smart choice. After my squads conquer a site, I could requests workers from the site and they will become citizens on my site.

***

A great battle have taken place **inside** my fortress. If I have to name it, I would name it "the battle of hundred hungry heads(hungry heads are giant bats that live inside the caverns)". It have all started with my miners exploring the cavern and finding adamantines, but there are hundred of hungry heads wondering near the treasure. My miners couldn't even reach adamantines without getting their heads bite off. 

So I did the obvious thing, I send the military forces. I thought it's a win-win-win, because real combat improves a dwarf's fighting skill way more quickly than training and there would be hundreds meat unit from the hungry head's corpses, while my miners could safely mine the adamantine. But things turns out to be win-win-win-loss, although the battle did improves my fighter's skill and got a bunch of hungry head meats while ensure the safety of mining adamantine, 5 of my regular citizens also end up in the battle and 3 of them got killed.

1.6.23

What a marvelous coincidence! My old military commander die in a battle of defense, I haven't bury him, and he turned into a ghost, staying in the outdoors of where he died. He didn't do anything so I ignored him. But after the battle of hungry heads, I wanted to see some more killings and send a squad after him. But it's impossible to kill someone who is already dead, in fact, there's not even fighting taking place. 

After I realize that, I cancel my order of killing the ghost. 50 elves and humans ambush my fortress ground right after my dwarfs starts to returning to the fortress. I ordered them to went back and a fight broke out. The result is nearly the same as always, my fighters killed all of the invaders without getting killed. But this time, I manage to catch an invader alive, but unfortunately it's only an horse. 

***

Moving industries to the caverns are actually easier than I thought, I don't even need mine-carts. Caverns are so rich of materials that collecting new ones are actually easier than moving old ones. So I could just build new workshops and collect materials instead of hauling them down 150 levels. 

***

Requesting workers from other sites is an tough job, in fact, I don't even know how it works. The only dwarfs that can be requested to my site are historical figures. In other words, they are dwarfs that have done something worth remembering and can be read on legends mode. And to requests them, a messenger is require. But for some reason they didn't do what I order them to do.

2.6.23

My dwarfs seems to be working very slowly lately, and the reason for that? Lagging; turns out dwarf fortress needs a higher requirement of CPU than I thought. Dwarf fortress must be lagging since my population reach 50, but the speed must have decreased slowly and that's why I haven't notice it for so long.

11.6.23

I have been playing dwarf fortress with FPS observation. My population reached 50 dwarfs without any lagging. But after it reached 80 there's a bit of lagging, although my FPS is above 80 which is playable in my opinion. My goal is to have a 100 dwarfs population and have a FPS above 80 without game alteration. But if I can't have that, 100 dwarfs population with and 80 FPS with some game alteration that won't have a big impact on the game is also fine with me.

12.6.23

My computer fail to run dwarf fortress with 100 dwarfs and above 80 FPS. But lucky, it manage to run 100 dwarfs and 95 FPS with temperature and weather alteration.

13.6.23

The decrease rate of FPS in dwarf fortress after my computer reached it's limit is insane. I managed to get a FPS of 95 with a normal 4 * 4 site that have exactly 100 dwarfs. But after my population rose to 102, FPS decreased to 80, and sometimes even dropped to 70.

***

A military is make up of two things, soldiers and equipment. Suppose you only have a military with 20 novice-level soldiers(novice is the second lowest level) and your fortress is going to be invaded in a short time, how can you build a strong military out of your current military? Soldiers isn't the key because training good soldiers require many years; but making equipment compare to training solders require no time at all. But what's the equipment that can manage over-power mega-beasts and goblin invasions? Adamantine.

Adamantine equipment is the best equipment for military, metal weapons have noway of slicing through adamantine armors, and adamantine weapons can slice through metal armors like cakes. But adamantine is very rare, so finding enough adamantine for 20 set of armors and weapons is very hard.

14.6.23

The meaning of caverns to dwarf fortress is like the meaning of dwarf fortress to me. 

Caverns is one of those *fun* places in dwarf fortress, it have many valuable materials and creatures; most of them doesn't appear elsewhere. It's also dangerous, intelligent creatures and beasts also live in the caverns; but that only make it more *fun*.

But it's also annoying in reality, caverns take up much of my CPU dill to it's complexity in path-finding and makes the game lag.   

15.6.23

Imagine this: the love god Eros from Greek myth flying in the sky with his bow and arrows, shooting at a crowd of humans on the ground. 

I tried to create this imagine in dwarf fortress, adventure mode. There's actually a good reason why this is useful in the game, let alone fun.

23.6.23-28.6.23: writing [[latest/dwarf fortress/Unfolding adventure mode]]. 


7.7.23

The only force that manage threatens my fortress are the super powerful mega-beasts, nor the wicked goblins; but the cursed Undeads. Saying that Undeads destroyed my site may not be entirely fair, they are only minions of a Necromancer. In the forces that destroyed by site, there's Necromancer taking the lead, with zombies following close behind it, there's also the undeads, 95% of the army are fill with them.

Zombies are nasty creatures, they have the ability to curse other creatures with a wave of its hand. they actually know not only one kind of curse, but many. It can creates bleeding, pain, poisoning, and dizziness and a kind that I forgot. But there's also a weakness in it's curses; it's a short range weapon and can only curse creatures that are in 15 tiles.

Necromancer is rather complicate, it can creates undead out of corpses and skeletons. But there's no garantee that the undeads it created will be on the same side as it. Theoretically, it can also sommon *nightmares* that are in it's side, but I never seen any Necromancer do it  in fortress mode.

Undeads invade sites in the goblin fashion, which is, direct attack and kill all the living thing in the fortress. They are also better than goblins at it too. Unlike goblins, they come in vast number, always manages to outnumbered my citizens. 

8.7.23

Another fortress have come and go; like nearly every other destruction of my fortresses, it's by the hands of undeads. My fortress was in it's early days with just 20 citizens, when an undead troop of 40 people attacked. I didn't even have a military yet; all my citizens are killed without mercy. What's even more upsetting is that not a undead soldiers have been killed throughout the battle. But, I got the key to stops undeads from destroying my site.  

It was pretty obvious to me that, military forces alone can not stop undead forces from destroying my site. So, I constructed a bunch of basic traps in my fortress main hall. They are; stone-fall trap, weapon trap, and cage trap. Stone-fall trap drop a stone on it's victim when activated; weapon trap works similarly, with weapons bashing it's victim. They did nothing to stops the undeads, they only managed to creates wounds in the undeads and wounds doesn't them. The cage traps were pretty successive compare to the first two, all of them manage to caught their victim. But a cage trap only can manage to catch one victim, so even after my cage traps caught all of it's victim, there's still enough undead to destroy my site. 

9.7.23

A were-beast attacked my site before the undeads, and guess how strong the were-beast is? It only take a blow from a novice soldier to take it down. 

10.7.23

Victory! My cage traps worked perfectly, an undead troop of 70 fighters attacked my sites, and they are all caught. I want their military equipment(it's worth a lot of money) and them dead without any of my citizens being harm. The question is, how can I manage that? The answer should be in [[Projects]]


11.7.23

Elf sites are just so unpredictable. An Elf with less than 10 citizens manage to beat a well-train squad with well-craft equipment. And how did they manage that? Animals; the animals are so good at fighting that the Elves don't even have to get involve. They could just sit there, drinking soda while my dwarfs get their butt kicked rhinos, cheetahs, and other war beasts. Animals are also the same reason why I send my dwarfs to raid Elf site; Elf tamed animals such as grizzly bears and tigers are way more useful than dogs. 

I witness a cave in! Two of my miners are digging above the magma sea when a cave in occurred and they fell in. Which is bad, because I can't find their corpse and bury them. So the return as ghost which make my citizens very unhappy. 

12.7.23

The death of citizens and workers usually happen after I reach the cavern level.
