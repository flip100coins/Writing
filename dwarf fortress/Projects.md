## attribute project
Project goal: finding out how jobs influence contribute with [[public/dwarf fortress/Dwarf fortress|dwarf fortress]] mode.

Project plan: body contributes(body contributes are contributes involve with body) influence how fast dwarf learns in military training. The plan is to train all my workers, and see which work influence body contribute the most by the result of how fast they learn.

Project advantage: dwarfs like learning new things, so the project isn't going to influence by the dwarfs emotion.

Project disadvantage: the project can only find out how jobs influence body contributes.

Project details: creating a squad for every kind of workers and a separate training room for each squad.

Project update: nothing yet, I have been training wood workers, stone workers, and miners, but they seems to learn at the same speed. Maybe I'm wrong about jobs influence contributes. 

Project update: all  my squads seems to learn fighting at about the same speed. The only pattern I could find is that dwarfs with high learning skills learn things faster than those without. 

## Prisoner Project

Making all my prisoner take off the armors and drop their weapons aren't easy, but I think it can be done. First of all, I need to release them, and I need to kill them, because that's the only way to take of their armors and grab their weapons. But releasing them one by one and sending my military to kill them is both boring and slow. My plan is to design a trap, which will kill my released prisoners.

Trap design number 1:
