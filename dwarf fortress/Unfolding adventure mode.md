Adventure mode is kind of like fortress mode's sister. Everything on the screen in adventure mode is exactly the same with fortress mode, the plants, the animals, the people, and the created goods. Adventure mode and fortress mode's likeness doesn't stops at the screen, if you play both modes on the same map, the civilizations, sites, historical figures, artifacts, and building will also be the same.

Like sisters in real life, adventure mode looks like fortress mode but are not exactly the same as fortress mode. The biggest difference is that in fortress mode, you control dozens, even hundreds of dwarfs; but in adventure mode you only got to control one dwarf. Since you are controlling a dwarf, you are seeing the world in a dwarf's angle and view.

## Time

In fortress mode, time passes in a constant speed. A day in fortress mode is equal to 40 seconds in real life, unless, your computer is lagging. But in adventure mode, the real time-game time equation depends on what you are doing. If you are doing nothing at all, time stops in adventure mode. 

## Sites

Sites is a complex element in adventure mode. There's useful products in almost every sites, like well-craft weapons and armors; it's also a place full with intelligent creatures; some sites are also targets for elimination; and they are only way to visit the caverns.

There are many kind of sites, dwarf sites, goblin sites, elf sites, human sites and many more. There's two kind of dwarf sites, fortresses and hillocks. Fortresses are one complex, gigantic hole dug deep underground; while hillocks are more like real life village with small, above and underground buildings. The goblins site are almost the same as dwarf sites, goblins has their fortress that are call dark fortress and also has their own hillock with the name dark pit. Elves only live on tree houses, which gives them a natural adventure when it comes to defending sites(shooting arrows down the trees is always easy than shooting the other way around). The humans in dwarf fortress, like the humans in real life, live in above-ground buildings.

Beside the sites of the main civilizations, there's the sites of undead and bandits. 

## Attribute

Since you are only controlling one dwarf, attributes in adventure mode is a lot more important than in fortress mode. They affects your character's body and are directly involve with how it's mind works. 

## Skills

In fortress mode, it's very easy to improve labor skills for dwarfs. To improve labor skills, one can just assign a dwarf a certain labor and it will improve the skills involve with that labor when it does the job. The dwarfs can do a specify labor as many times as you can assign them before their deaths; but they can only improve a skill to a certain level.

This is how the circle for laboring in fortress mode looks like: laboring --> improves skills that are involve with that labor --> the dwarf does that labor better --> laboring. 

Improving combats skills require a longer time, with the military training. But it's also fairly easy.

Here's the circle of improving combat skills: military training --> improves all the skill that are needed to win a fight --> military training. 

***

In adventure mode, improving labor skills is almost impossible. Because you can't do any jobs that can improve the skill until you learn the skill. The labor circle for fortress mode is broken in adventure mode at the beginning. But it's still possible to learn a labor skill in adventure mode, players can visit guildhalls, which is a place for teaching and learning certain labor skills. But guildhalls is one of the very rarest building and getting permission to visit one is also a tough job.

Circle of improving labor skills in adventure mode: learning a skill in a guildhall --> doing the labor involving the skill --> improving the skill --> doing the labor involving the skill.

Improving combat skills in adventure mode are both easier and more dangerous. There's no military training in adventure mode; so the only way to improve combat skills is real fighting. Real fight is nothing like military training, a player improves their combat skills, or they die trying. But the good news is, finding a training target is way more easier than finding a guildhall, there's plenty of creatures that are weaker than you.

Circle of improving combats skills in adventure mode: real battle --> improving combat skills --> real battle.

And the version of circle breaking: real battle --> death.

## Combats

Combats are the soul of adventure mode. There are times when I'm playing fortress mode; and wishing I could switch to adventure mode with one of the fighters as my character when a war occurred. 

There's only 4 things that matter in a fight, combat skills, weapons, armors , and body 
attributes.

### Combat skills

There are many kind of combat skills, sword skill, spear skill, mace skill, crossbow skill, bow skill and many more.
