I think the middle toe of my left foot is not good. The nail grow weird, and the color is brown. So I do some research on internet in the following 2 days.
From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC88888/#sec-13title

According DIAGNOSIS OF ONYCHOMYCOSIS in that article, I  suspect that is onychomycosis(灰甲), since I do have moccasin tinea pedis（足廯） currently.

I go to see a doctor and he sure that is onychomycosis, no testing, no prescription. But he did check my nail, and he felt the nail is brittle. He also told me I should remove all the brittle nail part since there are lot of fungi. And he said he was not sure the little toe of my right foot was infected.
The doctor suggest me not using oral medicine right now but topical antifungal cream or ointment. What he worried is that my age is not young and the oral medicine is bad to liver and kidney.

I got following prescription from bard about the treatment of tinea pedis and onychomycosis.

# Moccasin tinea pedis
Moccasin tinea pedis is a chronic form of athlete's foot that affects the entire sole of the foot. It is often characterized by thick, scaly skin and a white, powdery appearance. The standard treatment for moccasin tinea pedis is a topical antifungal cream or ointment.

Some common topical antifungal creams and ointments that are used to treat moccasin tinea pedis include:

- **Terbinafine (Lamisil)**
- **Econazole (Spectazole)**
- **Miconazole (Monistat)**
- **Clotrimazole (Lotrimin)**

These creams and ointments should be applied to the affected area twice daily for at least 2 weeks. If the infection does not clear up after 2 weeks, you may need to see a doctor for further treatment.

In addition to using a topical antifungal cream or ointment, it is also important to keep your feet clean and dry. You should wash your feet with soap and water daily and dry them thoroughly. You should also avoid wearing tight-fitting shoes and socks that do not allow your feet to breathe.

# Onychomycosis
Onychomycosis, also known as toenail fungus, is a fungal infection of the toenails. It is a common problem that can affect people of all ages. The fungus that causes onychomycosis thrives in warm, moist environments, so it is more likely to develop if you have sweaty feet or if you wear tight-fitting shoes.

If you have moccasin tinea pedis, you are at an increased risk of developing onychomycosis. This is because the fungus that causes moccasin tinea pedis can also infect the toenails.

The treatment for onychomycosis depends on the severity of the infection. In mild cases, topical antifungal creams or ointments may be effective. However, in more severe cases, oral antifungal medications may be necessary.

Some common oral antifungal medications that are used to treat onychomycosis include:

- **Terbinafine (Lamisil)**(兰美抒，又叫特比奈芬)
- **Itraconazole (Sporanox)**
- **Griseofulvin (Gris-PEG)**

These medications should be taken for at least 6 weeks. If the infection does not clear up after 6 weeks, you may need to see a doctor for further treatment.

In addition to taking oral antifungal medications, it is also important to keep your feet clean and dry. You should wash your feet with soap and water daily and dry them thoroughly. You should also avoid wearing tight-fitting shoes and socks that do not allow your feet to breathe.

Since the first article was published at 1998, I must find a better solution at present. Search on NCBI, I found https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9484770/#s0005title . This article was published at 2022.
Oral antifungals are generally recommended for moderate to severe onychomycosis and topical antifungals for mild to moderate disease[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9484770/#cit0002)

The link above (2019) show amorolfine 5% nail lacquer has better  antifungal efficacy than other  topical therapy formulation.

I decide use amorolfine 5% nail lacquer first, maybe 1-2 months we could see something happen, since my case is not severe.
