- Periodontal (牙周) Anatomy – Gingival Margin

- Gum/Gingiva (牙龈)
 
- Gingival sulcus/gingival crevice:
Gingival sulcus is a small space between a tooth and its surrounding gum. It's filled with fluid and acts as a moat that keep the root of tooth from bacteria. Normal gingival sulcus depth is 1 to 3mm. When gum recedes, the space will be deepened, and thus create a periodontal pocket. The depth of recession can be measured with a basic periodontal examination [BPE](https://www.bsperio.org.uk/assets/downloads/BSP_BPE_Guidelines_2019.pdf). 
Notice total loss of attachment = gingival recession + probing depth (see [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gingival_and_periodontal_pocket) section "Periodontal pocket"), but the examination only measure probing depth. What's the significance of this?

# Plague
Plague is a sticky, acidic firm of bacteria, which feed on food debris such as sugar and carbohydrates. Plague forms constantly on your teeth. It is important to remove them daily by brushing and flossing. Leave alone, it can cause cavities, gingivitis(gum disease). 
	[An Overview of Different Interdental Cleaning Aids and Their Effectiveness](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6630384/) shows that interdental brush are effective in removing plague as far as 2-2.5 mm below gingival margin.

Scaling removes plaque or tartar from around the gum margins.

# Tartar (Dental Calculus)
	Tartar, also called dental calculus (a funny name),  is hardened plague.
