# diagnosis:
possible cause:
1. bad sitting posture put too much stress on tailbone

2. lumbar disc herniation: rubbery disc pushing outward
Lumbar Disc Herniation, this article has some information of identify the problematic disc

- inner the nucleus pulposus is composed of approximatelly 80% water, type 2 collagen and proteoglycans.
- outer ring shape annulus fibrosus is made of type 2 collagen in inner part, while outer part is type 1 collagen

- posture improving exercise:
Stand against a wall so your tailbone, shoulder blades, and head are all pressed against the surface.
Place your hands on the wall at shoulder level with your elbows bent at 45 degrees and your palms facing forward.
Slowly extend your arms up the wall. Raise your hands as far as is comfortable while keeping your tailbone, shoulder blades, and head stationary and in constant contact with the wall.
Slowly return to the starting position. You should take about five to 10 seconds to reach up, and another five to 10 seconds to lower your arms.
Repeat eight to 12 times, or three to five times if you suffer from shoulder problems.
Better posture, better mood
A preliminary study suggests an upright posture may improve symptoms of depression. The study, in the March 2017 Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry, involved 61 people with mild to moderate depression. The group as a whole was more likely to sit with stooped shoulders and a rounded back compared with people who did not have depression. Half the people were allowed to sit in their usual slouched position, and the other half sat upright, with physiotherapy tape placed on their shoulders and back to help them maintain good posture. Both groups underwent tests designed to raise stress levels and then filled out questionnaires to measure their mood symptoms. The researchers found that those who sat in the upright posture had lower levels of fatigue and anxiety.
